Dialogflow CX Webhook Integration with Express and ngrok
This repository contains a Dialogflow CX agent integrated with a webhook built using Node.js and Express. The webhook processes user requests, handles fulfillment, and delivers dynamic responses from the server. ngrok is used to expose your local server to the internet for testing purposes with Dialogflow.

Features
Webhook Fulfillment: Processes requests from Dialogflow CX and sends real-time, dynamic responses.
Express Framework: Lightweight server setup using Express for handling HTTP requests.
ngrok Integration: Exposes your local server for webhook testing in a Dialogflow CX agent.
Easy Deployment: Ready to deploy on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or other Node.js hosting services.
Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dialogflow-webhook-handler.git
cd dialogflow-webhook-handler
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory to configure environment settings:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=3000
4. Run the Express Server
Start your Express server by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
5. Use ngrok to Expose Local Server
To make your local webhook accessible to Dialogflow, run ngrok to tunnel the Express server:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 3000
Copy the generated ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io) and use it in Dialogflow CX.

6. Webhook Configuration in Dialogflow CX
Go to your Dialogflow CX agent.
Navigate to Fulfillment and add the ngrok URL followed by /webhook (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhook) as your webhook endpoint.
